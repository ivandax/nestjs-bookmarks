## Useful commands

- Quickly create modules using the CLI, like a user module:

`nest g module user`

- Start the DB using docker:

`docker compose up dev-db -d`

After it runs you can check it with:

`docker ps`

Copy the container id and check the logs with:

`docker logs <id>`

You can quickly create a new controller with the CLI like:

`nest g controller user --no-spec`

## Prisma

Prisma is an ORM (Object relation mapper)

We have installed the Prisma extension to get proper formatting

To initialize a prisma schema file, we run:

`npx prisma init`

Then after defining our schema, we can generate these tables in our DB (as long as it's already running in DOCKER)

`npx prisma migrate dev`

We can run a command to open the Prisma Studio to browse through our data:

`npx prisma studio`

We can reset a migration with:

`npx prisma migrate reset`

Prisma has custom codes for many different possible errors, see more here:

[Prisma Errors](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/error-reference)

We can re-run existing migrations:

`npx prisma migrate deploy`

## Connecting to the Docker container DB from external tools like pgAdmin 4

- We can do it with psql too:

`psql -h localhost -p 5434 -U postgres -d nest`

## Accesing data from the request

Nest js gives us the option to reference the underlying Express variables, like Request:

```
  @Post('signup')
  signup(@Req() req: Request) {
    console.log(req.body);
    return this.authService.signup();
  }
```
