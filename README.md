## Useful commands

 - Quickly create modules using the CLI, like a user module:

 `nest g module user`

 - Start the DB using docker:

 `docker compose up dev-db -d`

 After it runs you can check it with:

 `docker ps`

 Copy the container id and check the logs with:

 `docker logs <id>`

## Prisma

Prisma is an ORM (Object relation mapper)

We have installed the Prisma extension to get proper formatting

To initialize a prisma schema file, we run:

`npx prisma init`

Then after defining our schema, we can generate these tables in our DB (as long as it's already running in DOCKER)

`npx prisma migrate dev`

We can run a command to open the Prisma Studio to browse through our data:

`npx prisma studio`

## Accesing data from the request

Nest js gives us the option to reference the underlying Express variables, like Request:

```
  @Post('signup')
  signup(@Req() req: Request) {
    console.log(req.body);
    return this.authService.signup();
  }
```
